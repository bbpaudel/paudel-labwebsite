    We developed an automated image analytical pipeline to process replicative budding events from Microfluidic microscopic images. The pipeline Microfluidic (Micro) Budding Replicative Events Workflow (BREW)--MicroBREW automatically detects and process high-throughput images and results in easy-to-summarize results.
