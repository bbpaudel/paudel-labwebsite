I am an undergraduate Biomedical Engineering student at the University of Virginia with a strong interest in cancer biology and translational medicine. Since joining the lab in Fall 2025, I have worked closely with Dr. Bishal Paudel to develop expertise in cell culture techniques and optimize cell proliferation assays in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) models.

Through this work, I have gained a deeper understanding of the molecular drivers of AML progression and treatment resistance. My research interests center on identifying high-risk AML subgroups and translating mechanistic insights into clinically actionable strategies. I plan to pursue a physician-scientist (MD) pathway focused on advancing translational oncology research.
