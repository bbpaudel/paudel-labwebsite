I am a Research Technician with a Bachelor of Medical Science from the University of Western Sydney. My academic background provided me with a comprehensive foundation in biology. I moved to the University of Virginia (UVA) to further expand my research skills and gain advanced training under the mentorship of Dr. Bishal Paudel in the Department of Medicine and Biomedical Engineering. In my current role, I support ongoing research projects through experimental design, data collection  while continuing to develop my expertise in biomedical science and translational research.
