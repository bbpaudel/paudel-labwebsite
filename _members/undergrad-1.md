I am an undergraduate Biology student at the University of Virginia dedicated to uncovering the molecular drivers of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Within the lab, I utilize in-vitro models to investigate the biochemical and genomic mechanisms underlying AML pathogenesis, with the ultimate goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets. Prior to joining the lab, I gained unique clinical insight into oncology by serving as an EMT and working in the hospital setting. This perspective fuels my commitment to translational research as I prepare for a future career in medicine.
