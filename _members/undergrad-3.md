I am an undergraduate student at the University of Virginia majoring in Computer Science. My technical expertise and interests include full-stack software engineering, machine learning, AI automation, image processing, and data handling.

I have collaborated with the Smith Lab in the Department of Biochemistry & Molecular Genetics alongside Dr. Bishal Paudel, where our work focused on building an automatic pipeline/tool that helped with the study of Yeast replicative lifespan (RLS).

My experiences across research has shaped my interest in developing computational tools and software that turns meaningful data into impactful solutions.
