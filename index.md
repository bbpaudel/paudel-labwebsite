Welcome to the **Paudel Lab** at the University of Virginia Comprehensive Cancer Center.  
We develop **data-driven and systems biology approaches** to understand cancer metabolism, drug response, and cellular heterogeneity by integrating multi-omics data, computational modeling, and experimental measurements.

The long-term objective of our research program is to gain a predictive understanding of how dysregulated signaling (altered metabolism, transport, etc.) gives rise to emergent cancer phenotypes and their associated vulnerabilities.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research focuses on **integrating transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and functional assays** to build quantitative models of cancer cell behavior. We are particularly interested in emergent cancer phenotypes and how signaling network states shape therapeutic response and resistance.

We develop and apply **computational tools**, statistical frameworks, and network-based models to analyze complex biological datasets. Our projects span **experimentation, multi-modal data integration, metabolic network modeling, and statistical modeling for predictive signatures** that support translational cancer research.
