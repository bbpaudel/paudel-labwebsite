Our lab uses systems biology to understand how dysfunctional signaling states drive cancer heterogeneity and therapeutic response. By integrating multi-omics data with computational and experimental models, we identify mechanisms and vulnerabilities that enable precision cancer treatment. Current projects include: 
1. Defining metabolic heterogeneity in tumors
2. Identifying therapeutic vulnerabilities and risk-classification
3. Determining links between altered epigenome and tumorigenesis

This page highlights software tools, datasets, and research-driven resources developed to support data analysis, reproducibility, and integrative modeling. The projects span methodological development, computational workflows, and applied analyses, with an emphasis on transparency, usability, and impact across biomedical and quantitative research. We welcome feedback, comments on the usability of these tools.
